Based on what you just learned in the previous exercise make a 
function that is called circleCircumference() that takes radius 
as a parameter and returns the circumference of a circle. Use 
console.log() to print your result to know when you've got it. 

Remember that the circumference of a circle is calculated as 2 * 
π * r 

Javascript has a built-in way to express Pi ... like this 
Math.PI use it in place of π in your calculation. example 
output... 

circleCircumference(10) //will return 62.83 
circleCircumference(2)) //will return 12.57 
circleCircumference(22)) //will return 138.23
